# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera

I'm taking Deep Learning class taught by Prof. Andrew Ng at Coursera.

Course 1, 2 and 3 were completed. Working on Course 4 and 5 now.
Course 1 certificate: https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/LTTPM9T9WBE6
Course 2 certificate: https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/7GL8Y5RUBA8T
Course 3 certificate: https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/WA9FQM6DBBMF

I found a very similar curriculum at this repository, https://github.com/Kulbear/deep-learning-coursera 

I created a previate branch and only posted my code after each assignment's due date.
